10 ShapeEditor – Implementing List View, Import, and Export

.. tab:: 中文

   In this chapter we continue our implementation of the ShapeEditor application.
   We will start by implementing a "list" view to show the available shapefiles, and then
   work through the details of importing and exporting shapefiles via a web interface.

   In this chapter, we will learn the following:

   - Displaying a list of records using a Django template
   - Dealing with the complexities of shapefile data, including issues with geometries and attribute data types
   - Importing a shapefile's data using a web interface
   - Exporting a shapefile using a web interface

   Let's start by implementing the view the user will see when they start running
   the ShapeEditor.
