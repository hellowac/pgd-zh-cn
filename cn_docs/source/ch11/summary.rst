Summary

.. tab:: 中文

    In this chapter, we finished implementing a sophisticated geospatial web application
    using GeoDjango, Mapnik, PostGIS, OGR, and pyproj. This application is useful
    in its own right, as well as being a springboard to developing your own geospatial
    web applications.

    We have learned:

    - That we can easily create our own Tile Map Server using Mapnik and GeoDjango.
    - That we can include OpenLayers on our own web pages, independent of GeoDjango, and display map data from our Tile Map Server.
    - How to create a custom "click handler" to respond to mouse-clicks within an OpenLayers map.
    - That we can use AJAX calls to have the server respond to events within the web browser.
    - That GeoDjango provides a powerful query language for performing spatial queries without writing a single line of SQL.
    - How to "borrow" geometry editing widgets from GeoDjango and use them within your own web application.
    - That you can create your own GeoModelAdmin subclass to change the appearance and functionality of GeoDjango's geometry editing widgets.
    - That you can use a simple HTML form to confirm the deletion of a record.

    This completes our exploration of GeoDjango, and also completes this book. Hopefully you have learned a lot about geospatial development, and how to create geospatial applications using Python. With these tools at your disposal, you are now ready to start developing your own complex geospatial systems. Have fun!
