使用 ShapeEditor
============================================

Using ShapeEditor

.. tab:: 中文

    Congratulations! You have just finished implementing the last of the ShapeEditor's
    features, and you now have a complete working geospatial application built using
    GeoDjango. Using the ShapeEditor, you can import shapefiles, view their features
    and the feature attributes, make changes to the feature geometries, add and delete
    features, and then export the shapefile again.

    This is certainly a useful application. Even if you don't have a full-blown GIS system
    installed, you can now make quick and easy changes to a shapefile's contents using
    the ShapeEditor. And, of course, the ShapeEditor is a great starting point for the
    development of your own geospatial applications.
