GIS

.. tab:: 中文

    The term GIS generally refers to Geographical Information Systems, which are complex computer systems for storing, manipulating, and displaying geospatial data. GIS can also be used to refer to the more general Geographic Information Sciences, which is the science surrounding the use of GIS systems.

    In this chapter we will look at:

    - The central GIS concepts you will have to become familiar with: location, distance, units, projections, datums, coordinate systems, and shapes
    - Some of the major data formats you are likely to encounter when working with geospatial data
    - Some of the processes involved in working directly with geospatial data
