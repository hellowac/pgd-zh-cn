3 Python Libraries for Geospatial Development

.. tab:: 中文

    This chapter examines a number of libraries and other tools which can be used for geospatial development in Python.

    More specifically, we will cover:

    - Python libraries for reading and writing geospatial data
    - Python libraries for dealing with map projections
    - Libraries for analyzing and manipulating geospatial data directly within your Python programs
    - Tools for visualizing geospatial data

    Note that there are two types of geospatial tools which are not discussed in this chapter: geospatial databases and geospatial web toolkits. Both of these will be examined in detail later in this book.
