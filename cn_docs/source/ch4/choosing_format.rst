Choosing your geospatial data source

.. tab:: 中文

    If you need to obtain map data, images, elevations, or place names for use in your
    geospatial applications, the sources we have covered should give you everything
    you need. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list—other sources of data are available,
    and can be found online using a search engine or sites such as http://freegis.org.

    The following table lists the various requirements you may have for geospatial data
    in your application development, and which data source(s) may be most appropriate
    in each case:

    .. csv-table::
        :header: "Requirement", "Suitable data sources"

        "Simple base map", "World Borders Dataset"
        "Shaded relief (pseudo-3D) maps", "GLOBE or NED data processed using gdaldem; Natural Earth raster images"
        "Street map", "OpenStreetMap"
        "City outlines", "TIGER (US); Natural Earth urban areas"
        "Detailed country outlines", "GSHHS Level 1"
        "Photorealistic images of the Earth", "Landsat"
        "City and place names", "GNIS (US) or Geonet Names Server (elsewhere)"
