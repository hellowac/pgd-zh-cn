4 Sources of Geospatial Data

.. tab:: 中文

    When creating a geospatial application, the data you use will be just as important
    as the code you write. High-quality geospatial data, and in particular base maps and
    imagery, will be the cornerstone of your application. If your maps don't look good,
    then your application will be treated as the work of an amateur, no matter how well
    you write the rest of your program.

    Traditionally, geospatial data has been treated as a valuable and scarce resource,
    being sold commercially for many thousands of dollars and with strict licensing
    constraints. Fortunately, as with the trend towards "democratizing" geospatial tools,
    geospatial data is now becoming increasingly available for free and with little or no
    restriction on its use. There are still situations where you may have to pay for data,
    for example, to guarantee the quality of the data, or if you need something that isn't
    available elsewhere, but it is now usually just a case of downloading the data you
    need, for free, from a suitable server.

    This chapter provides an overview of some of these major sources of freely-available
    geospatial data. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but rather to provide
    information on the sources which are likely to be most useful to the Python
    geospatial developer.

    In this chapter, we will cover:

    - Some of the major freely-available sources of vector-format geospatial data
    - Some of the main freely-available sources of raster geospatial data
    - Sources of other types of freely-available geospatial data, concentrating on databases of city and other place names
