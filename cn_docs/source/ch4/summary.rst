Summary

    In this chapter, we have surveyed a number of sources of freely-available geospatial data. We have learned that:

    - OpenStreetMap is a collaborative website where people can create and edit vector maps worldwide.
    - TIGER is a service of the US Geological Survey providing geospatial data on streets, railways, rivers, lakes, geographic boundaries, and legal and statistical entities such as school districts and urban regions.
    - Natural Earth Data is an excellent source for physical and cultural boundaries in vector format, as well as various raster-format visualizations of the Earth.
    - GSHHS is a high-resolution shoreline database containing detailed vector data for shorelines, lakes, and rivers worldwide.
    - The World Borders Dataset is a simple vector data source containing country borders and related data for the entire world bundled into one convenient package.
    - Landsat provides detailed raster satellite imagery of all land masses on
    the Earth.
    - GLOBE provides medium-resolution digital elevation (DEM) data for the entire world.
    - The National Elevation Dataset includes high-resolution digital elevation (DEM) data for the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and other US territories.
    - The GEOnet Names Server provides information on official place names for every country other than the US and Antarctica.
    - GNIS provides official place names for the United States.

    In the next chapter, we will use the Python toolkits described in *Chapter 3, Python Libraries for Geospatial Development*, to work with some of this geospatial data in interesting and useful ways.
