5 Working with Geospatial Data in Python

.. tab:: 中文

   In this chapter, we combine the Python libraries and geospatial data covered earlier
   to accomplish a variety of tasks. These tasks have been chosen to demonstrate various
   techniques for working with geospatial data in your Python programs; while in some
   cases there are quicker and easier ways to achieve these results (for example, using
   command-line utilities), we will create these solutions in Python so you can learn
   how to work with geospatial data in your own Python programs.
   This chapter will cover:

   - Reading and writing geospatial data in both vector and raster format
   - Changing the datums and projections used by geospatial data
   - Representing and storing geospatial data within your Python programs
   - Performing geospatial calculations on points, lines, and polygons
   - Converting and standardizing units of geometry and distance

   This chapter is formatted like a cookbook, detailing various real-world tasks you might want to perform and providing "recipes" for accomplishing them.
