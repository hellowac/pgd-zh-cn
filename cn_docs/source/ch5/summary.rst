    In this chapter we have looked at various techniques for using OGR, GDAL, Shapely, and pyproj within Python programs to solve real-world problems. We have learned the following:

    - Reading and writing to vector-format geospatial data in shapefiles
    - Reading and analyzing raster-format geospatial data
    - Changing the datum and projection used by a shapefile
    - Using the Well-Known Text (WKT) format to represent geospatial features and spatial references in plain text
    - Using WKT to transfer geospatial data from one Python library to another
    - Using WKT to store geospatial data in plain text format
    - Using the Shapely library to perform various geospatial calculations on geometries, including distance calculations, dilation, and intersections.
    - Using the pyproj.Proj class to convert coordinates from one projection and datum to another
    - Using the pyproj.Geod class to convert from geometry coordinates to distances, and vice versa

    Up to now, we have written programs that work directly with shapefiles and other data sources to load and then process geospatial data. In the next chapter, we will look at ways in which databases can be used to store and work with geospatial data. This is much faster and more scalable than storing geospatial data in files which have to be imported each time they are used.
