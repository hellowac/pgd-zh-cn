6 GIS in the Database

.. tab:: 中文

   This chapter examines the various open source options for storing geospatial data in a database. More specifically, we will cover:

   - The concept of a spatially-enabled database
   - Spatial indexes and how they work
   - A summary of the major open-source spatial databases
   - Recommended best practices for storing spatial data in a database
   - Working with geospatial databases using Python

   This chapter is intended to be an introduction to using databases in a geospatial application; *Chapter 7, Working with Spatial Data*, will build on this to perform powerful spatial queries that are not possible using shapefiles and other geospatial data files.
