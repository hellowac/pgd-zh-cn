    In this chapter, we have taken an in-depth look at the concept of storing spatial data in a database, and examined three of the principal open source spatial databases. We have seen the following:

    - Spatial databases differ from ordinary relational databases as they directly support spatial data types, spatial queries, and spatial joins
    - Spatial indexes generally make use of R-Tree data structures to represent nested hierarchies of bounding boxes
    - Spatial indexes can be used to quickly find geometries based on their position in space, as well as for performing spatial comparisons between geometries based on their bounding boxes
    - MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, has spatial capabilities built in, though with some limitations
    - PostGIS is considered to be the powerhouse of spatial databases, built on top of the PostgreSQL open source database engine
    - SpatiaLite is an extension to the SQLite serverless database, with a large number of spatial capabilities built in
    - Each database has a set of best practices for working with geospatial data
    - MySQL is an adequate though limited spatial database, PostGIS is a complex workhorse that scales well, and SpatiaLite is surprisingly capable but is quirky and suffers from bugs
    - All three spatial databases are powerful enough to use in complex, real-world geospatial applications, and that the choice of which database to use often comes down to personal preference and availability

    In the next chapter, we will look at how we can use spatial databases to solve a variety of geospatial problems while building a sophisticated geospatial application.
