7 Working with Spatial Data

.. tab:: 中文

   In this chapter we will apply and build on the knowledge we have gained in previous chapters to create a hypothetical web application called **DISTAL (Distance-based Identification of Shorelines, Towns And Lakes)**. In the process of building this application, we will learn the following:

   - Working with substantial amounts of geospatial data stored in a database
   - Performing complex spatial database queries
   - Dealing with accurate distance-based calculations and limiting queries by distance
   - Reviewing and improving a geospatial application's design and implementation
   - Handling usability, quality, and performance issues
