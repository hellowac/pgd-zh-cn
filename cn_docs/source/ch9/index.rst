9 Putting It All Together – a Complete Mapping System

.. tab:: 中文

   In the final three chapters of this book, we will bring together all the topics discussed
   in previous chapters to implement a sophisticated web-based mapping application
   called ShapeEditor.

   In this chapter, we will cover the following:

   - Designing a geospatial system, and then translating that design into code
   - Structuring of Django-based web applications
   - Setting up a new Django project and its applications
   - Learn how Django represents data structures as objects
   - Using GeoDjango's built-in "admin" application to view and edit geospatial data
