    Before you can build the ShapeEditor application, make sure that you have installed
    the following libraries and tools introduced in *Chapter 3, Python Libraries for Geospatial
    Development and Chapter 6, GIS in the Database*:

    - OGR
    - Mapnik
    - PROJ.4
    - pyproj
    - PostgreSQL
    - PostGIS
    - psycopg2

    You will also need to download and install Django. Django (https://djangoproject.
    com) comes with GeoDjango built-in, so once you've installed Django itself you're all
    set to go. Click on the **Download** link on the Django website and download the latest
    official version of the Django software. We'll be using Django 1.4 for the ShapeEditor.

    If your computer runs Microsoft Windows, you may need to download a utility to
    decompress the *.tar.gz* file before you can use it.
    
    Once you have downloaded it, you can install Django by following the instructions
    in the Django Installation Guide. This can be found at:
    
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install
    
    Once you have installed it, you may want to run through the GeoDjango tutorial
    (available at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis),
    though this isn't required to build the ShapeEditor application.
