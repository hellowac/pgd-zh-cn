Summary

.. tab:: 中文

    You have now finished implementing the first part of the ShapeEditor application.
    Even at this early stage, you have made good progress, learning how GeoDjango
    works, designing the application, and laying the foundations for the functionality
    you will implement in the next two chapters.

    In this chapter, you have learned the following:
    
    - The GeoDjango extension to Django can be used to build sophisticated geospatial web applications
    - A Django project consists of a single database and multiple Django applications
    - Breaking a complex project into a number of smaller applications and making them all work together
    - Django uses objects to represent records in the database
    - A Django view is a Python function, which responds when a given URL is called
    - The mapping from URLs to views is controlled by a URLConf module named urls.py defined at the project level
    - Django uses a powerful templating system to simplify the creation of complex HTML pages
    - Django allows you to define forms for handling the input of data
    - Django form fields make it easy to accept and validate a variety of different types of data
    - GeoDjango provides its own set of form fields for editing geospatial data
    - An application's data objects are defined in a file called models.py
    - GeoDjango's built-in "admin" system allows you to view and edit geospatial data using slippy maps

    In *Chapter 10, ShapeEditor – Implementing List View, Import, and Export*, we will
    implement a view to show the available shapefiles, as well as write rather complex
    code for importing and exporting shapefiles.
